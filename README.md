# Snailrace

Command Line Game for Linux in Haskell.

Two snails race for the finish line. Player 1 must alternate the keys A
& S, Player 2 alternates the keys K & L, to move the snail towards the
finish line. First one there wins.

Frustrating and engaging at the same time, be prepared to work your
fingers and have fun!
